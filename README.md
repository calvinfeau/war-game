### Battle
The winner of each round adds to its deck the opponent's card just played. 
<br>If the battle was won with a Jack, the opponent gives the first card on top of the deck as an extra gain. If the battle was won with a Queen, the two cards on top are added, if it's with a King the top 3 cards and if it's an Ace, the top 4 cards.
<br> As the classic version, it's the first player with no cards left that looses!
